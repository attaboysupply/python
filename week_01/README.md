## WEEK 01

This initial project was to get a simple calculator running on Python.

### Thought Process

For this calculator my thought process was to define a set of functions. Add, subtract, multiply, divide.
Then I decided to use the if/else satemente to determine which function the user is trying to perform.
By inputing each of the functions I defined in my list the user is then prompted to enter a first number and a second number.
After they input both numbers I used the print command to then output the function and result of the calculation.

I indentified each of the number inputs as floats as well in order to handle multiplying with decimals.
